## Single shot

**sbw0010_0020 Master — MS, eye-level, static**

```
Cinematic poetic Americana, naturalistic soft lighting, subtle 35mm film grain, lyrical tracking movement, shot on spherical 40mm lens at f/2.8, Dante Ariola and Lance Acord influence, William Eggleston color sensibility — Eli Manning at window, contemplative, eyes toward snowfall, quiet resolve. Medium shot, eye-level, rule of thirds with slight lead room left, minimal headroom. Static framing with implied gentle push-in energy. Soft window key from left wraps cheek, negative fill right, medium-shallow depth of field. Light snow falling outside catching backlight, steam on glass, faint breath condensation. Warm tabletop practicals dim in background bokeh (#F4E4C1 warm glow). Fine 35mm grain, subtle halation on highlights, protected shadow detail.
