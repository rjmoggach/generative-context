# Changelog

All notable changes to the Generative AI Context Library will be documented in this file.

## v0.5.1 - 2026-06-30

### New skill: image-edit (image-to-image) — closes the i2i coverage gap

- Added `image-edit` skill — the still sibling of `footage-transform`: write/refine i2i prompts that preserve a real photo or generated still and change one thing (recolor/material, swap the background/crowd/world around a preserved subject, add or progress a wound, age a face, relight/regrade, remove/clean up, or compose locked references into a new scene). Trigger phrases include "change this image to X", "swap the crowd/background/wardrobe", "make these fans Moroccan instead of Dutch", "recolor this costume". Previously these requests had no home — `footage-transform` is v2v-only.
- Added foundation craft guide `context/guide-image-editing.md` (preserve-then-change, the four edit mechanisms, the denoise-strength dial, lighting integration, common edit types).
- Added foundation craft guide `context/guide-asset-reference.md` (anchor-then-fan-out, identity-block vs scene-block, reference-vs-LoRA decision gate, effective reference counts, multi-reference composition) — the shared spine for the upcoming art-department asset layer (v0.6+).
- Wired `image-edit` into `skills/build.py` and `plugin/assemble.py`; docs updated to six skills.
- Added `ROADMAP.md` (and staged stub crew/skills under `roadmap/`) planning the v0.6+ art department: Production Designer, casting, costume, makeup/hair, propmaster, location scout — character sheets, prop turntables, and location packs.

## v0.5.0 - 2026-06-30

### New skill: footage-transform (video-to-video)

- Added `footage-transform` skill — write/refine v2v prompts that preserve a real source clip and change one thing (add a VFX element, swap the environment, drop in a photoreal creature, sync a camera move to a spoken line, generate a transformed start frame).
- Added model-agnostic craft guide `context/guide-footage-transformation.md` (preserve-then-change, lighting/optics integration, timed moves with dual anchors, prepended-intro duration budget, first-frame workflow).
- Refreshed `context/model-video-seedance-pro.md` to Seedance 2.x: video-to-video `@source`/`@creature` input grammar, NON-IP guardrail, SFX-line convention, and 2.x input limits.
- Wired the new skill into `skills/build.py` and `plugin/assemble.py`; docs updated to five skills.

## v0.4.1 - 2026-06-30

### Distribution fix

- Ship a prebuilt `generative-cinema.plugin` at the repo root so Cowork users can install without building it.
- `plugin/assemble.py --package` now writes the artifact to the repo root (was a hardcoded session path).
- Un-ignored the committed root `generative-cinema.plugin` in `.gitignore`.
- README Cowork install now links the prebuilt file; maintenance note covers rebuilding/committing it on release.

## v0.2 - 2026-06-29

### Model currency refresh (June 2026)

- Added `context/model-currency-2026-06.md` as the single source of truth for current model versions.
- Added a currency callout to each of the 9 original model docs (FLUX.2, Nano Banana 2, Midjourney v8.1, Seedream 5, Seedance 2.5, Runway Gen-4.5, Veo 3.1, Luma Ray3.2).

### New model docs (12 models total)

- `model-video-kling-3.md` - Kling 3.0 (native 4K, fluid motion, Motion Control/Brush).
- `model-video-sora-2.md` - Sora 2 / 2 Pro (multi-shot storytelling, native dialogue; API sunset Sep 24 2026).
- `model-video-wan-2-6.md` - Wan 2.6 (open-weights, native audio/lip-sync, self-hostable).

### Cinematic craft guides (decision-support)

Heuristic-format guides (Decision / Use when / Because / Prompt translation / Watch-outs / Anchors):

- `guide-shot-selection.md`, `guide-lens-language.md`, `guide-continuity-rules.md`, `guide-sequence-construction.md` (P0).
- `guide-visual-structure.md`, `guide-color-story.md`, `guide-creative-approaches.md` (P1).
- `guide-ai-generation-strategy.md` (P2 - craft under current model limits).
- See `docs/history/CRAFT-EXPANSION-PROPOSAL.md` for the original roadmap.

### Agent skills (`skills/`)

Evolved the Custom GPT prompts into self-contained, progressively-disclosed skills:

- `project-context` (visual DNA interview), `sequence-design` (scene/coverage planning), `shot-prompt` (six-layer prompt generation), `model-docs` (document/refresh a model).
- `skills/build.py` syncs `context/` into each skill's bundled `references/` and packages installable `.skill` files to `skills/dist/` (git-ignored).
- Pipeline: project-context -> sequence-design -> shot-prompt -> prompts.
