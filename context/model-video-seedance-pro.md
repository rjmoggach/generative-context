## Overview

Seedance 1.0 Pro is a state-of-the-art video generation model from ByteDance. It excels at creating high-definition (1080p) videos from both text and image prompts. Its key strengths are its advanced semantic understanding, strong prompt adherence, and a unique ability to generate coherent, multi-shot narrative sequences. The model produces videos with smooth motion and can adapt to a wide variety of cinematic and artistic styles.

> **Warning:** Seedance does **not** support negative prompts. Your prompt must focus on describing what you want to see.

## When to Use This Model

Seedance is the premier choice for creating **short, cinematic, narrative-driven video clips**. It is particularly powerful for generating sequences with multiple shots or complex camera movements.

- **Use Seedance for**: Storyboarding, creating short film clips, animating characters with consistent identity, and producing dynamic, multi-shot sequences.
- **Consider other models for**: Generating videos longer than 10 seconds, or for simple, single-shot animations where narrative is not a priority.

## Prompting Structure

Seedance prompts are built around **motion**. The core of the prompt should describe the subject, its actions, and the camera work.

**Core Framework**: `[Subject] [Movement/Action] in [Scene], [Camera/Lens], [Style]`

```
+----------------+---------------------+----------------+----------------------+
| Subject        | Movement/Action     | Scene/Style    | Camera               |
+----------------+---------------------+----------------+----------------------+
| "A lone astronaut" | "walks vigorously"  | "on Mars,     | "the camera slowly    |
|                |                     | cinematic style" | pushes in"           |
+----------------+---------------------+----------------+----------------------+
```

> **Tip:** Always include adverbs of degree (e.g., `quickly`, `slowly`, `vigorously`) to control the intensity of the motion. The model does not infer this.

## Parameters

Parameters are appended to the end of the text prompt using `--` syntax.

| Parameter | Syntax | Values | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resolution | `--rs` | `480p`, `1080p` | Varies | Sets the video resolution. |
| Duration | `--dur` | `5`, `10` | Varies | Sets the video length in seconds. |
| Fixed Camera | `--cf` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Locks camera position. Set to `false` for moving shots. |

## Techniques

### Basic: Simple Motion

Start with a clear subject and a single, well-defined action.

- **Good**: `"A car driving down a street."`
- **Better**: `"A vintage red convertible driving quickly down a rain-slicked city street at night."`

### Intermediate: Multi-Action Sequences

Describe a series of continuous actions for a single subject.

- **Prompt**: `"A woman picks up a glass from the table, takes a sip, and then places it back down, all in one smooth motion."`

### Advanced: Multi-Shot Narrative

This is Seedance's standout feature. Use the phrase **"shot switch"** or **"cut to"** to explicitly signal a transition between scenes. The model will maintain character and style consistency.

- **Prompt**: `"Close-up of a detective's determined face, cinematic lighting. Shot switch. A low-angle shot of him entering a dark, abandoned factory. Shot switch. The camera follows him as he discovers a single, muddy footprint on the concrete floor."`

## Common Workflows

### 1. Animating a Still Image (Image-to-Video)

Provide a starting image and describe the motion that should begin from that frame.

- **Workflow**: Generate a high-quality character portrait in Midjourney or Seedream.
- **Prompt**: `(With the portrait as input) "The person in the image slowly turns their head to the left and smiles, subtle motion."`

### 2. Creating a Cinematic Long Take

Combine multiple camera movements to create a single, unbroken shot.

- **Prompt**: `"The camera starts on a close-up of a key in a door, then pulls back to reveal a man opening it, follows him into a room, and finally pans across the room to a window showing a cityscape at night."`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Motion is static or weak** | The prompt lacks adverbs of degree or strong action verbs. | Add adverbs like `quickly`, `vigorously`, `gently` to describe the motion. Use dynamic verbs. |
| **Camera is not moving** | The `--cf` parameter was set to `true`, or no camera movement was described. | Ensure `--cf` is `false` and include explicit camera movement commands in the prompt (e.g., `pan left`, `zoom in`). |
| **I2V prompt fails** | The text prompt contradicts the content of the source image. | Ensure the prompt describes an action that logically follows from the image. Do not try to change the subject or background in an I2V prompt. |

## Integration

- **API Example**: API access is typically provided through platforms like BytePlus. The specific implementation will vary.
- **Workflow Position**: Seedance is a powerful tool for generating final video clips for creative projects, social media, and storyboarding.
- **Complementary Tools**: Use a high-quality image generation model like **Seedream 4.0** or **Midjourney** to create a starting frame for I2V generation, giving you more control over the initial scene composition.
