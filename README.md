# generative-cinema

**Version**: 0.5.1 · **Updated**: 2026-06-30

A flexible plugin for getting **cinematic, model-optimized prompts** for generative
image and video — at any level of structure. Ask for a great one-off still prompt,
the next shot from a still, a scene's coverage, a shot within a sequence, an edit to
a still or clip you already have, or the full project → sequence → shot chain. It
pairs a production *workflow* (skills) with a *crew* you talk to (agents), backed by a
film-grammar + craft + model reference library.

You are the **Creative Producer**: you set the brief and approve. The crew does the work.

This repository is also a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** — the installable
plugin lives in [`plugin/`](plugin/), and the editable source it's built from lives
at the repo root (`context/`, `skills/`).

## Install

**Cowork:** download the latest [`generative-cinema.plugin`](https://github.com/rjmoggach/generative-cinema/releases/latest/download/generative-cinema.plugin) from [Releases](https://github.com/rjmoggach/generative-cinema/releases/latest), open it in chat, and press install.

**Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add rjmoggach/generative-cinema
/plugin install generative-cinema@generative-cinema
```

Or from a local clone: `/plugin marketplace add ./generative-cinema` then the same install.

## Flexible entry — work at whatever level you have

| You want… | Ask | Who handles it |
|---|---|---|
| A great one-off still prompt | "great prompt for X" | `cinematographer` (or `shot-prompt`) |
| A shot from a still | "next shot from this still" | `cinematographer` |
| A scene's coverage / shot list | "break down this scene" | `first-ad` (or `sequence-design`) |
| A shot within a sequence | "give me the next shot" | `cinematographer` |
| To transform a clip you already have | "add X to this video / swap the world" | `cinematographer` (or `footage-transform`) |
| To edit a still you already have | "change this image to X / swap the background" | `cinematographer` (or `image-edit`) |
| A whole project's look first | "define the look" | `project-context` |
| The full chain | start at project, flow down | the crew, in order |

No project context is required for a one-off — only load a show bible when you want
every output locked to the same look.

## The crew

Skills are the production workflow; agents are the crew you talk to, applying the
skills' craft with a role's judgment.

### Skills (the workflow)

| Skill | Level | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `project-context` | Project | Visual-DNA interview → `project-context-{show-code}.md` |
| `sequence-design` | Scene | Plan coverage, staging, screen direction, intensity arc → shot list |
| `shot-prompt` | Shot | Six-layer, model-optimized prompts honoring the project look |
| `footage-transform` | Shot (v2v) | Video-to-video prompts: preserve a real clip, change one thing (VFX, world swap, timed moves) |
| `image-edit` | Shot (i2i) | Image-to-image prompts: preserve a real still, change one thing (recolor, world swap, add/age, relight, compose locked refs) |
| `model-docs` | Library | Research + write/refresh a model doc; sync currency |

### Agents (the crew)

| Agent | Role | You ask for |
|---|---|---|
| `director` | Director | Intent, approach, coverage calls, notes (you brief it as Creative Producer) |
| `cinematographer` | DP | "Give me the next shot" / "a great prompt for this still" — a finished prompt |
| `first-ad` | 1st AD | "Break down this scene" — an ordered coverage shot list |
| `script-supervisor` | Continuity | "Does this cut together?" — screen direction, eyelines, the line, look consistency |
| `researcher` | Research | "Research model X" — isolated web research feeding `model-docs` |

Typical flow: brief the **Director** → **1st AD** breaks down coverage → the **DP**
hands back each shot's prompt → the **Script Supervisor** checks it cuts together.
Or skip straight to the **DP** for a single shot or one-off still.

## Craft guides

Decision-support guides in `context/` (format: Decision / Use when / Because /
Prompt translation / Watch-outs / Anchors) that turn the taxonomy into judgment:
`guide-shot-selection`, `guide-lens-language`, `guide-continuity-rules`,
`guide-sequence-construction`, `guide-visual-structure` (contrast/affinity),
`guide-color-story`, `guide-creative-approaches`, `guide-ai-generation-strategy`.
Editing / asset workflow: `guide-footage-transformation` (video-to-video),
`guide-image-editing` (image-to-image), and `guide-asset-reference` (building reusable
character/prop/location anchors — the spine of the v0.6+ art department).
Foundations: `guide-prompting-framework` (the six-layer framework),
`reference-film-grammar`, `reference-film-movements`, and the `reference-visual-*`
style anchors (directors, cinematographers, commercial directors, photographers).

## Repository layout

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   This repo as a Claude Code marketplace → ./plugin
plugin/                           The installable generative-cinema plugin (assembled)
  ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
  ├── skills/   (6)   agents/ (5)   context/ (the bundled library)
  └── assemble.py                  Builds plugin/ from the repo-root sources
context/                          Source of truth: model docs, craft guides, references
skills/                           Source skill definitions (with bundled references/)
docs/                             Setup + workflow guides
prompts/                          Legacy Custom GPT system prompts + templates
knowledge-base/                   Primary-source film texts (Arijon, Mascelli, …)
```

`context/` and `skills/` are the editable source of truth. `python plugin/assemble.py`
regenerates `plugin/context/` and `plugin/skills/` with paths repointed to
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; the committed `plugin/` is the complete, self-contained
plugin. Use `--package` to also build the clickable `.plugin`.

---

## Maintenance

- **Refresh model facts:** `model-docs` skill (or the `researcher` agent); update `context/model-currency-2026-06.md`.
- **Add craft content:** write in the heuristic format under `context/`, wire into `skills/build.py` + `plugin/assemble.py`, rebuild.
- **Rebuild the plugin:** `python plugin/assemble.py` (add `--package` to build `generative-cinema.plugin`). The `.plugin` is **not** committed — attach it to a GitHub Release on each version bump (`gh release create vX.Y.Z generative-cinema.plugin`) so the Cowork download link stays current.
- **Log changes:** `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Legacy: Custom GPT deployment

The `prompts/system-prompt-*.md` files remain valid for ChatGPT Custom GPT setups
(`docs/01-setup-custom-gpt.md`). The plugin is the agent-native equivalent and is
preferred for Claude / Cowork.
