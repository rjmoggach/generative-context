## Notes

- Vehicle must always be pristine (no dirt, scratches, wear)
- Environments should feel aspirational but achievable (not fantasy)
- Human moments should feel authentic, not posed or stiff
- Every shot should feel expensive and premium - "you can see the budget"
- Reference rule: "If it doesn't look like it cost $500k to shoot, reframe it"
- Product shots: vehicle occupies 40-60% of frame, never 100%
- Character close-ups: eyes should be in focus, soft bokeh on background
